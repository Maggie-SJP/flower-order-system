Return one object per product.\n\n**About Sub-description:**\n- The \"Sub-description\" field should ONLY include **colours**.\n- Examples of valid values: white, pink, red, yellow, purple, green, orange, cream, burgundy, blue, lilac, etc.\n- Do NOT include terms like: Colombian, imported, tall, premium, 5 stems, mini, variety names, or country origins.\n- If the colour is embedded in the product name or customer notes, extract it and place it in the \"Sub-description\" field.\n- Do not repeat the colour in the \"Product Name\" — keep it separate.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"10 White Roses\" → Product Name: \"Rose\", Quantity: \"10\", Sub-description: \"White\"\n- \"Lisianthus Purple\" → Product Name: \"Lisianthus\", Sub-description: \"Purple\"\n- \"Chrysanthemum Yellow\" → Product Name: \"Chrysanthemum\", Sub-description: \"Yellow\"\n- \"Gymea\" → Product Name: \"Gymea\", Sub-description: \"\"\n- \"Disbud Rainbow\" → Product Name: \"Disbud\", Sub-description: \"Rainbow\" (if Rainbow is used as a known colour term)\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
