Output plain JSON only.\n- The most essential fields are \"Product Name\", \"Quantity\", and \"Colour\".\n- If any field is missing, leave it as an empty string.\n- Group unrelated or extra info into a \"Notes\" field.\n- There may be multiple products in one order. Return one object per product.\n\n**About the \"Colour\" field:**\n- The \"Colour\" field should ONLY include standard colour terms.\n- Valid examples: white, pink, red, yellow, purple, green, orange, cream, burgundy, blue, lilac, rainbow, etc.\n- DO NOT include terms like: Colombian, imported, tall, premium, mini, variety names, size (e.g. 5 stems), or country origins.\n- If the colour is embedded in the product name or customer notes, extract it and place it in the \"Colour\" field.\n- Do not repeat the colour in the \"Product Name\" — separate it clearly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"10 White Roses\" → Product Name: \"Rose\", Quantity: \"10\", Colour: \"White\"\n- \"Lisianthus Purple\" → Product Name: \"Lisianthus\", Colour: \"Purple\"\n- \"Chrysanthemum Yellow\" → Product Name: \"Chrysanthemum\", Colour: \"Yellow\"\n- \"Gymea\" → Product Name: \"Gymea\", Colour: \"\"\n- \"Disbud Rainbow\" → Product Name: \"Disbud\", Colour: \"Rainbow\"\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
