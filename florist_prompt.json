Return one object per product.\n\n**About the 'Colour Breakdown' Field:**\n- This field is meant to capture colour information **along with its corresponding quantity**, exactly as written by the customer.\n- For example: if the customer input says \"2 red / 2 orange / 1 yellow\", you must keep that entire phrase in the 'Colour Breakdown' field.\n- DO NOT drop the numbers. DO NOT rephrase or simplify the colours.\n- Keep the original structure, spacing, and slashes (or commas) exactly as they appear in the customer input.\n- If there is only one colour (e.g., \"White\"), just put that word.\n\n❌ Do NOT include:\n- Words like Colombian, imported, premium, mini, standard, tall, short, country names, variety names, or any non-colour descriptions.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"10 White Roses\" → Customer Input: \"Rose\", Quantity: \"10\", Colour Breakdown: \"White\"\n- Input: \"2 mid pink / 2 deep pink / 2 red / 2 orange / 1 yellow\" → Colour Breakdown: \"2 mid pink / 2 deep pink / 2 red / 2 orange / 1 yellow\"\n- Input: \"Lisianthus Purple\" → Customer Input: \"Lisianthus\", Colour Breakdown: \"Purple\"\n- Input: \"Gymea\" → Customer Input: \"Gymea\", Colour Breakdown: \"\"\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
