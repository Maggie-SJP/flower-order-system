Return one object per product.\n\n**About the Colour Field:**\n- Extract colour information into the \"Colour\" field only.\n- Valid examples include: white, pink, red, yellow, purple, green, orange, cream, burgundy, blue, lilac, rainbow, etc.\n- Do NOT include terms like: Colombian, imported, premium, tall, short, mini, standard, 5 stems, country names, or variety names.\n- If the colour appears inside the product name or in customer notes or separate fields, extract only the colour part.\n- Do NOT duplicate the colour inside the \"Product Name\".\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"10 White Roses\" → Product Name: \"Rose\", Quantity: \"10\", Colour: \"White\"\n- \"Lisianthus Purple\" → Product Name: \"Lisianthus\", Colour: \"Purple\"\n- \"Chrysanthemum Yellow\" → Product Name: \"Chrysanthemum\", Colour: \"Yellow\"\n- \"Gymea\" → Product Name: \"Gymea\", Colour: \"\"\n- \"Disbud Rainbow\" → Product Name: \"Disbud\", Colour: \"Rainbow\"\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
