Return one object per product.\n\n**About Sub-description:**\n- Add a \"Sub-description\" field to capture any colour, variety, size, or type modifier.\n- This may include words like: white, pink, premium, 5 stems, Colombian, dyed, mini, tall, imported, etc.\n- Sometimes the colour or variety appears in a separate field, or is embedded in the product name or customer notes. If found, extract it and place it in the \"Sub-description\" field.\n- Do not repeat the Sub-description in Product Name â€” keep it separated clearly.\n\nCommon product examples: \"Disbud Rainbow\", \"Chrysanthemum Imported\", \"Sunflower\", \"Gymea\", \"Tulips Normal\", \"Eucalyptus\", \"Spear Grass\", etc.\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
